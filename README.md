Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Convert the COCO dataset into YOLO format for object detection, segmentation, or keypoint detection tasks.

Train a YOLOv8 model on the converted dataset.

Visualize the training results.

The notebook includes helper functions for converting different types of COCO annotations (bounding boxes, segmentation masks, keypoints) into YOLO format and prepares the dataset for training.

Features
COCO to YOLO Conversion: Supports conversion of bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and keypoints.

Data Reduction: Optional reduction of dataset size for faster experimentation.

Parallel Processing: Uses multi-threading for efficient data processing.

YOLOv8 Training: Configures and trains YOLOv8 models for detection, segmentation, or pose estimation.

Visualization: Includes tools for visualizing training results and confusion matrices.

Requirements
Python 3.7+

Libraries:

ultralytics

numpy

opencv-python

matplotlib

scipy

torch

torchvision

tqdm

json

shutil

os

pathlib

concurrent.futures

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coco-to-yolov8.git
cd coco-to-yolov8
Install the required packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Mount Google Drive (if using Google Colab):

python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Usage
1. Configuration
Set the paths and parameters in the notebook:

python
HOME = Path.cwd()
COCO_PATH = Path('/content/drive/MyDrive/coco2017')
OUTPUT_PATH = HOME / 'data'
chosen_annotation_type = 'segmentation'  # 'bbox', 'keypoints', or 'segmentation'
train_reduce_factor = 0.1  # Fraction of training data to use
val_reduce_factor = 0.2    # Fraction of validation data to use
2. Data Preparation
Run the data preparation cells to convert the COCO dataset into YOLO format:

python
# Create output directories
for split in ['train', 'val']:
    for subdir in ['images', 'labels']:
        (OUTPUT_PATH / split / subdir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Process datasets
process_dataset('train', reduce_factor=train_reduce_factor, annotation_type=chosen_annotation_type)
process_dataset('val', reduce_factor=val_reduce_factor, annotation_type=chosen_annotation_type)
3. Training
Train the YOLOv8 model:

python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Choose the appropriate model based on the annotation type
if chosen_annotation_type == 'bbox':
    model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
    train_folder = 'detect'
elif chosen_annotation_type == 'segmentation':
    model = YOLO("yolov8n-seg.pt")
    train_folder = 'segment'
elif chosen_annotation_type == 'keypoints':
    model = YOLO("yolov8n-pose.pt")
    train_folder = 'pose'

# Train the model
results = model.train(data=f"{HOME}/data/config.yaml", epochs=10, imgsz=640)
4. Visualization
Visualize the training results:

python
from IPython.display import Image

# Display training results
print(f"Displaying training results for {chosen_annotation_type}...")
!ls {HOME}/runs/{train_folder}/train
Image(filename=f'{HOME}/runs/{train_folder}/train/confusion_matrix.png', width=600)
Configuration
The config.yaml file is automatically generated based on the chosen annotation type. For segmentation, it includes:

yaml
path: /content/data
train: train/images
val: val/images
nc: 80
names: [list of class names]
For keypoints, it includes additional keypoint shape and flip indices.

Training
The model is trained for 10 epochs by default. You can adjust the number of epochs and other hyperparameters in the model.train() call.

Key metrics monitored during training:

Box loss

Segmentation loss

Classification loss

Mask precision and recall

Results
After training, the model's performance can be evaluated using the validation set. The notebook includes visualization of the confusion matrix and other training metrics.
